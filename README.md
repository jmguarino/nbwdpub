A public version of my wedding website northbayweddingday.com

I made this last year as a way of providing a means to rsvp to our wedding, and for general information on the venue. I started with a parallax scrolling template from Prime Design and built the javascript and php code needed to make the rsvp functionality work (and also set up the mysql database needed).
